# NP_Optical
Contains the scripts used to acquire data for each type of stimulation trial (.py files), and the empirically-gathered SA-LTMR responses used to generate the "physiological" laser trains (in "SA-LTMR example traces" directory).

# NP_Analyze:
Contains the data analysis pipeline (in analysis.ipynb), and the script used to concatenate OpenEphys binary files into a single recording file per experiment (concatenate_openephys.ipynb).
